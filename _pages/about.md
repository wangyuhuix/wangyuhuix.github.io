 I received my Ph.D. in the College of Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), supervised by Professor [Xiaoyang Tan](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/xtan/) in 2021. I received my M.S. degree in software engineering from NUAA in 2017. 

My research interests focus on reinforcement learning, especially on multi-step off-policy learning and the ones involving uncertainty or hidden information  .

I am currently serving as a reviewer for NeurIPS’2020,2021, ICLR’2021,2022, ICML’2021.
