I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [KAUST Generative AI](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/research/generative-ai) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), working with Professor [Jürgen Schmidhuber](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/people/person/jurgen-schmidhuber).
 I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degree in the College of Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, supervised by Professor [Xiaoyang Tan](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/xtan/) in 2022 and 2017. 

My research interests focus on reinforcement learning, with an emphasis on long-horizon decision making, policy optimization, and efficient exploration. I study both the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of RL, including credit assignment under sparse rewards, stability of policy learning, and exploration–exploitation trade-offs. My work aims to develop scalable RL methods for complex sequential decision problems, with applications to intelligent agents and control systems.

I am currently serving as a reviewer for NeurIPS’2020,2021, ICLR’2021,2022, ICML’2021.
